#ZTM-RustImageApp

A small project, part of the Zero To Mastery Angular Course, that's used to explain WebAssembly and Rust. The final goal of the original project is to be able to grayscale an image via the browser, using a WebAssembly application.
I'll make additional comments on the project, and further develop it.
